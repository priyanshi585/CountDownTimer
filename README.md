<h1>⏳ Countdown Timer ⏰</h1>

This is a simple yet elegant Countdown Timer built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It dynamically updates the remaining time (in days, hours, minutes, and seconds) until a specified target date and time. This project helped me understand how JavaScript can be used for real-time DOM updates and time-based calculations.

<h2> 📌 Features</h2>
- Real-time countdown display
- Clean and minimal UI
- Responsive layout (can be improved further)
- Easy to customize target date

<h2>🛠 Technologies Used</h2>
<b>HTML</b> – For structure
<b>CSS</b> – For basic styling
<b>JavaScript</b> – For logic and dynamic behavior

<h2>✍️ What I Learned</h2>
- Working with the JavaScript Date object
- Real-time DOM manipulation using querySelectorAll and setInterval()
- Time conversion logic (seconds → minutes → hours → days)
- Handling UI updates based on logic
